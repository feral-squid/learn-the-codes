# learn-the-codes
Simple spreadsheet to train on PLU codes for grocery stores. The product list is approrpriate for the store I am working at, here near the end of the summer season.

The first tab is the Product List, comprising a list of SKU numbers in column A and the corresponding product descriptions in column B. The list may be modified by simply editing the entries on the Product List Tab. Just be careful that there are no gaps in the list:

Wrong:

	4073 Red Potato
	4072 Russet Potato

	4816 Sweet Potato
	4799 Beefsteak Tomato
	4087 Roma Tomato

Correct:

	4073 Red Potato
	4072 Russet Potato
	4816 Sweet Potato
	4799 Beefsteak Tomato
	4087 Roma Tomato

There is no need to sort in any kind of numerical or alphabetical order. Duplicates entries will not hurt anything. There is no restriction to the number of items in the list.

The second tab is the Test Me page. A random product is displayed at the top, and your goal is to enter the SKU number for that product in column A below. The result of your entry will be displayed in column B, and the description at the top will update to another randomly selected product.

Once you have filled the Test Me list with attempts, you may start over by deleting the SKUs. Important: DO NOT delete the product column, only the SKU column.

I found this useful as a training tool to help me learn the product codes when I first started. There is an Excel version, and a Numbers version.
